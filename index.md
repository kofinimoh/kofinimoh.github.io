For twenty years I have been a freelance Software Engineer, constantly learning and applying cumulative knowledge to projects in many organisations across multiple industries.  I carry out my freelance activities through Nimoh Consulting.
For a half of those twenty years I have applied the both the same and some other complimentary skills in building innovative tools with Nimoh Scientific.
I live in the New Forest, England.
